Good work by Motorola. The screen is good camera portrait shots are also amazing. performance is also good in daily uses. Not recommended for gamers. Only 1 compromise with the battery you have but you have 68wt fast charging. Overall i like it because i require a small compact device with a good camera.   \n",
