But sometimes I feel the photos are over saturated. Awesome display. And the smart connect feature is damn useful and great. The back cover is good quality. And the leather is smelling very nice and sweet. And I chose this phone over edge 50 and edge 50 fusion just because of its flat display.
In short if you need a good ph...
